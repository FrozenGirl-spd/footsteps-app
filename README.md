## ü§∑ About
Finding great resources to learn is hard... Google Search doesn't help since it's the website with the best SEO that wins! Even if I find the resources, where do I keep a sorted list of them? Managing them gets harder every day. 

With Footsteps app & [browser extension](https://github.com/fnplus/footsteps-extension) we're trying to curate the best resources from the internet and make it easy for individuals to find quality resources to learn, keep a track of their learning. Every resource is called a 'footstep' (added in a chronological manner) and a collection of footsteps makes up a learning path.
